<h2>UX/UI Report Design Projects - Scenario Reporting</h2>

###Environmental Profile Declaration (EPD) Labels

[Generate labels for products](../../../io/template/), communities, families and individuals based on the Environmental Product Declaration (OpenEPD) standard. (Opportunities to use OpenEPD for Low Carbon Procurement Policies.)

Render labels using client-side Javascript (maybe TypeScript) with the OpenEPD API (mayb save as static files for faster performance).  Maybe use our paser for displaying [YAML and JSON as HTML](../../../io/template/parser/)

Design an expandable [impact label interface](../../../io/template/) that works well as a hero/video overlay.  

Mockup a "Community Hotspot Environmental Report" (CHER) that expands impact reporting labels to full page size and include graphics and colors that convey impact levels. Impacts could be conveyed by 5-stars, faces, green-orange-red colors, burning earth images, Last Airbender symbols, etc. The more options the better.  

Update the [impact widgets US map](../../../localsite/info/#geoview=country) with [chloroform&nbsp;map features](../../map/income/) including population density, income and industry levels.

[View 3.0 Mockup](../../../apps/smm/) of labels and tabulator. (OpenLCA Tabulator)
